<!-- about the project -->
## Course project

The first project was to analyse the time complexity of pattern identification in a text string ( which is used to simulate and RNA sequence). The team explored using KMP, Brute force, Two jump algorithms for pattern matching

The team experimented the time complexity of each algorithm and proposed that the KMP and 2 jump algo are the most suitable for the problem at hand

## 2nd Project

The second project was to discover the shiortest paths  from a certain location to the hospital in an undirected unweighted graph. We have used breath first search in the project as breadth first search ensures that it is the shortest path.
The team exprimented the effects of increasing the number of hospitals and the number of paths
